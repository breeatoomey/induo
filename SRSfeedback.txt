=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Great work on this section.  'nuff said.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   This is the most complete job on functional requirements of the semester
   so far.  VERY nice work on this section.

   A couple of tips: whenever you see the word "and" in a requirement, be
   sure to investigate as possibly two or even three separate requirements.
   Also, the numbering should be more consistent, like:

      5.3    Functional Requirements
      5.3.1  CSC or CSU heading
      5.3.1.1 requirement one
      5.3.1.2 requirement two
      5.3.1.3 smaller function sub-heading [not a requirement]
      5.3.1.3.1   sub-requirement one
      5.3.1.3.2   sub-requirement two

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Perfect job on this section!

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Perfect job on this section!

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown                 1/1
   Functional Requirements             4/4
   Performance Requirements            2/2
   Environment Requirements            1/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                            8/8
   Preliminary Schedule                2/2
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus

This is actually complete enough to get full credit for the document as is.
Nothing else to do unless you want to do some clean-up as indicated in the
functional comments above.

Great work, you three!
