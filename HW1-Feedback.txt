CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
======================

SUMMARY:
   Good work on the synopsis, identifying the most salient points of the
   article, such as 'normal' accidents and the inspectors of the FAA and at
   ValuJet.

CRITICAL THINKING:
   Relation to S/W engineering:
      Good evaluation of the parts of software systems as complex interfaces
      that are analogous to the system of systems in the airliner.  I like
      your idea of the 'holistic approach' which carefully considers those
      interactions.

   Thoughts/opinions presented:
      Good ideas in this section, such as the fact that human error can have
      devastating consequences and being proactive about risk management.
