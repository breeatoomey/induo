Project Proposal Feedback
Project: induo
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
VERY complete proposal document!  One of the best I've seen for the way
you give the problem statement as well as your solution.  Having the key
features in a bullet list cuts down on the text reading for that section
but don't be afraid of puttong SOME text in ~ having nothing but lists
like this can make the reader feel like they are not getting the full
explanation.

Your justification section is great!

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
VERY nice poster!  I like the color scheme, quite non-traditional and modern
and the pictures are great.  The idea is presented clearly and from the user
perspective.  Nicely done ~ someone has a very good 'eye'....


Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall on the document.

Keep up the good work!
